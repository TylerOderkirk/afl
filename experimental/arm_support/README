This directory contains replacement files that should enable experimental
ARMv7 instrumentation in place of the default x86 code.

This code is confirmed to work only insofar that it allows libpng and jpeg9c
to be compiled and run without catching fire - but it certainly isn't as
well-tested or as optimized as its x86 counterpart.

To use: copy the files to the main afl source code directory (../../),
overwriting the original versions of these files; type in 'make clean all';
and cross your fingers for good measure.
