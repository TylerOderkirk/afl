Here's my current wishlist for afl:

  - Proper distributed fuzzing support. Probably something like this:

    - Master publishes a list of test cases to fuzz (det or havoc),
      along with current bitmap

    - Clients can claim a test case and do one round of fuzzing,

    - Clients phone back with any new bits,

    - Server decides to accept and ask for test cases, or reject.

    - Clients ask for another test case.

    - If a client disconnects, its pending test case is returned to the
      bunch.

  - Part #2 of Jann's fork server patch.

  - ARM port.

  - Experimental support for ASAN edge coverage, instead of a custom GCC hack.
    This is not yet shipping with clang, so not very urgent.

  - Refactored fuzz_one to make it easier to plug custom mutators as
    standalone mods.

  - afl-fuzz.c broken into several files?

  - Real support for threads (one prev_loc per tid?).
