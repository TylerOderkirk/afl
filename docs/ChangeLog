--------------
Version 0.39b:
--------------

  - Redesigned status screen, now 90% more spiffy.

  - More verbose and user-friendly messages for some common problems.

  - Resuming now reconstructs path depth, too.

--------------
Version 0.38b:
--------------

  - Fixed an fd leak and +cov tracking bug resulting from changes in 0.37b.

  - Screen update speed now auto-adjusts.

  - Visual indication of non-instrumented mode.

--------------
Version 0.37b:
--------------

  - Added fuzz state tracking for more seamless resumption of aborted
    fuzzing sessions.

  - Removed the -D option, as it's no longer necessary.

  - Refactored calibration code and improved startup reporting.

  - Dynamically scaled timeouts.

  - Visual notification for slow binaries.

  - Improved instrumentation to explicitly cover the other leg of every
    branch.

--------------
Version 0.36b:
--------------

  - Fork server support to avoid the overhead of execve(). A nearly-verbatim
    design from Jann Horn; still pending part 2 that would also skip initial
    setup steps (thinking about reliable heuristics now).

  - Added a check for shell scripts used as fuzz targets.

  - Added a check for fuzz jobs that don't seem to be finding anything.

  - Fixes to how IGNORE_FINDS works (was a bit broken after adding splicing
    and path skip heuristics).

--------------
Version 0.35b:
--------------

  - 64-bit instrumentation properly integrated into afl-as.

--------------
Version 0.34b:
--------------

  - New exec count classifier (the working theory is that it gets meaningful
    coverage with fewer test cases spewed out).

--------------
Version 0.33b:
--------------

  - New, somewhat experimental instrumentation that tries to target only
    arcs, rather than every line. May be fragile, but is a lot faster (2x+).
    Old version included in experimental/old_as/ for time being.

  - Several cosmetic fixes and typo corrections, thanks to Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.32b:
--------------

  - Another take at fixing the C++ exception thing.

--------------
Version 0.31b:
--------------

  - Followup fix to afl-as to address a potential problem with newer versions
    of GCC introduced in 0.28b. Thanks to Jann Horn.

--------------
Version 0.30b:
--------------

  - More detail about the underlying operations captured in file names.

--------------
Version 0.29b:
--------------

  - Improvements to chunk operations.

--------------
Version 0.28b:
--------------

  - C++ exception handling fix for newer versions of GCC (thanks to 
    Eberhard Mattes).

  - Fix to the handling of the overflow flag (thanks to Eberhard Mattes).

--------------
Version 0.27b:
--------------

  - Extra prioritization of new paths versus already-fuzzed ones.

  - Include spliced test case ID in the output file name.

  - Fixed a rare, cosmetic null ptr deref after Ctrl-C.

  - Make copies of test cases in the output directory.

  - Use better output file names, keeping track of stage and splicing sources.

--------------
Version 0.26b:
--------------

  - Revamped storage of testcases, -u option removed,

  - Built-in effort minimizer to get rid of potentially redundant inputs,

  - Standalone testcase count minimization script in experimental/,

  - Miscellaneous improvements to directory and file handling.

  - Bug fix to timeout detection.

--------------
Version 0.25b:
--------------

  - Improved count-based instrumentation.

  - Improvements to hang deduplication.

  - New -cov prefixes for test cases.

  - Switched from readdir() to scandir() + alphasort() to preserve ordering of
    test cases.

  - Splicing strategy,

  - Display improvements and several other bugfixes.

--------------
Version 0.24b:
--------------

  - Program name on the progress screen and the -T parameter to go with it.

--------------
Version 0.23b:
--------------

  - Improved detection of variable behaviors.

  - Path depth tracking and several other display improvements.

  - Simplified (XOR-based) tuple instrumentation.

--------------
Version 0.22b:
--------------

  - More proper handling of long bitflips and some swaps.

  - Fix for the handling of gcc -pipe.

--------------
Version 0.21b:
--------------

  - Initial public release.
